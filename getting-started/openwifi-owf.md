# OpenWiFi (OWF)

The Telecom Infra Project's OpenWiFi is an initiative aimed at democratizing WiFi access by creating a disaggregated WiFi architecture that includes open-source software and hardware solutions. The project enables service providers to deploy, manage, and scale WiFi networks more efficiently, offering interoperability across different devices and manufacturers. By fostering collaboration among industry leaders and developers, OpenWiFi seeks to create a more versatile and cost-effective wireless infrastructure, ultimately benefiting consumers with better connectivity options.
