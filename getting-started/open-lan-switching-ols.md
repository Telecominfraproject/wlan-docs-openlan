# Open Lan Switching (OLS)

Open LAN Switching is an initiative under the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) aimed at transforming local area network (LAN) infrastructures. It focuses on promoting open-source solutions and interoperable hardware to create more flexible and cost-effective network environments. By leveraging open standards, Open LAN Switching seeks to:

* **Enhance Network Interoperability**: Encourage seamless communication between different vendor equipment.
* **Reduce Costs**: Lower capital expenditures by using commoditized hardware and open software solutions.
* **Increase Innovation**: Allow more rapid development and deployment of new services and features.

Through collaborative effort, Open LAN Switching aims to redefine network paradigms by enabling a wider ecosystem of vendors and solutions in enterprise networking.
